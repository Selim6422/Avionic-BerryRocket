<h1>Avionic BerryRocket type nÂ°1</h1>
        
<h2>BerryRocket is a project that aims to simplify the availability of elements to realize hobby rocket projects. This avionics is the 2021/2022 version.</h2>

*Open hardware license project*

<p>The architecture of this avionics is very simple. It is composed of: a Rapsberry Pico hosting the RP2040 microcontroller. A commercial Pico-10DOF-IMU board which includes an ICM20948 (3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, and 3-axis magnetometer) and a LPS22HB barometric pressure sensor, for sensing the atmospheric pressure of the environment. A home-made interface board, the berryRocket Electronic, including the whole power supply by regulator, buzzer and analog accelerometer using a limit switch.</p>
